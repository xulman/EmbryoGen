how to create the jar file:
$ jar cfm SimViewer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  ../entryPointAddendum.txt  de

where 1/2:
$ cat ../entryPointAddendum.txt
Main-Class: de.mpicbg.ulman.simviewer.StartUpScene
Class-Path: dependency/scenery-0.6.2.jar dependency/jeromq-0.4.3.jar

(the previous empty line must be part of the file and must be empty)

where 2/2:
$ ls de/mpicbg/ulman/simviewer/
gives a bunch of *class files from the project

how to populate the target/dependency folder:
$ mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package
(likely only mvn dependency:copy-dependencies would do it)

how to run it:
$ java -jar SimViewer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
