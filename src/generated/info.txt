The purpose of this folder is to collect all source files (such as boilerplate
code) that are automagically generated at compile time. This folder shall come
empty (except this file) from freshly cloned repository.

After a successful compilation, the following files should appear here:

git_hash.hpp
buckets_with_graphics.pb.h
buckets_with_graphics.pb.cc
buckets_with_graphics.grpc.pb.h
buckets_with_graphics.grpc.pb.cc


Since the generated files are included at places in the project, we prefer to
keep these files within the 'src' folder tree and not anywhere _outside_ it
such as where products of compilation are normally stored.
