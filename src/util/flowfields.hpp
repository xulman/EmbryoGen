/**

 *
 * This function transforms given image \e srcImg according to the given
 * vector flow field \e FF in the forward direction. This means that it
 * basically reads voxel value at certain position in the image \e srcImg
 * and places it in the \e dstImg at position shifted by a vector which is
 * found in the flow field at the same position. The shift vector may be,
 * however, any real number which renders the new position to be off the
 * voxel grid. In this case, the stored value is spread into surrounding voxels.
 *
 * The function assumes that vector flow field "fits" over the transformed
 * image \e srcImg perfectly, i.e. the size, resolution, and offset of the flow
 * fields are the same as of the \e srcImg. In this way, the flow field can be
 * easily applied. The flow field vectors are expected to represent the shift
 * in microns and are recalculated/projected to image coordinates using the image
 * resolution.
 *
 * The output image \e dstImg copies metadata information, inc. size, from
 * the source image \e srcImg. All voxel values are zeroed before the transformation.
 *
 * \param[in] srcImg	image to be transformed

 * The function adds "radially" distributed vectors to every vector in the vector
 * flow field \e FF.
 *
 * For every first \e BPOuterCnt points in the \e BPList, the point position is
 * projected to the flow field \e FF and a normalized (magnitude 1) vector pointing
 * from here towards the \e BPCentre is established. This established vector is multiplied
 * with some weighting function and the results are stored in the flow field at positions
 * along the line from \e BPCentre towards a position of the examined point from \e BPList.
 *
 * The weighting function is zero (0) in the \e BPCentre, increases with the distance from it,
 * reaches one (1) at the examined point from \e BPList and decreases further. The weighting
 * function is further multiplied with a value from the \e hintArray.
 *
 * As we are advancing in the \e BPList, we advance also in the \e hintArray. Advances in
 * the \e BPList are, however, in one-by-one fashion; in the \e hintArray advances are by
 * the value of \e hintInc. The length of the \e hintArray must be at least \e BPOuterCnt.
 * Note that a certain line from the Cell::scmPnHints image can be used or one may supply
 * just single constant while providing \e hintInc = 0 at the same time.
 *
 * With small cells (radius below 3-4 microns), there is rather strong disproportion
 * of volume added/removed to/from cell if a boundary point is supposed to move by given
 * number of microns. In other words, if we decide to move all boundary points radially
 * from a cell centre by X microns, the volume added in the end is actually larger than
 * what we can expect from just increasing radius by X. In order to achieve expected increase
 * of volume, one must compensate for it and move all boundary points radially from the
 * cell centre by a little bit less than X microns. The compensation can be turned on with
 * the last parameter \e compensation. The expected increase of volume is understood as
 * the number of (outer) boundary pixels times area of one pixel (depends on the image resolution)
 * times the increase (a height of the block) in microns. Yes, this is crude approximation.
 *
 * The function fills only portion of the flow field, in contrast to, e.g., DescribeTranslation().
 *
 * If \e eFF is not NULL, the function also fills this flow field provided
 * its pixel grid aligns with the one from \e FF. The \e eFF may overlay
 * over the \e FF freely. Parts of \e eFF outside the \e FF boundary are
 * filled with zero vectors. While \e FF may already contain something to which
